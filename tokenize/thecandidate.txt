I’ll ask people what they like to do for fun to get a sense of if they fit, if they are more than just a drone…. Then I really shift to who is this person…. I’ll ask them pretty open-ended questions like, “Have you enjoyed law school? Why did you decide to go to law school?” Why are they picking my firm? Why are they sitting in my office and talking to me?
 	In the firms I studied, evaluators believed that a list of impressive or relevant accomplishments on a résumé was insufficient for signaling an applicant’s true level of ambition and interest in the job. To gauge that, interviewers needed to hear candidates tell compelling and emotionally arousing narratives about their life experiences. 

a consultant named Justin confirmed. “[The candidates] all have the credentials,”  “But,” he continued, “I want to know about their stories.” For lawyer Rebecca, successful narratives were ones that provided a glimpse into the person behind the résumé. “If they’ve gotten good grades and are on the law review, then I’ll know that they have the ability to do the job,” she said. “But I want more. I’m looking for their ability to talk about themselves and who they really are…. I want to know what makes them interesting and special.”
